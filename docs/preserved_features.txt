Custom GraphCanvas tweaks (pending reimplementation)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Edge management
   - Custom removable edges with inline delete button (RemovableEdge component).
   - onCreateEdge/onRemoveEdges callbacks to sync edges with backend.
   - Additional validation preventing agent-to-agent and non-empty data connections.

2. Provider-aware node data
   - Passing providerOptions and upstream source nodes into FlowNodeCard for richer UI.

3. Aggressive layout fixes
   - Multiple resize timers and manual fitView calls to adjust viewport.
   - Transparent background wrapper + empty-state overlay.

4. Debug logging
   - Console logs for project load and viewport adjustments.

These enhancements were causing instability; revisit after stabilising the base GraphCanvas.
